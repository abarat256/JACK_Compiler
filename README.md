# JACK_Compiler
JACK is a rip off of JAVA (it's a simpler coding language with minimal syntax). This compiler compiles code written in JACK . A compiler consists of a Symbol Table, a Tokenizer and a Code Writer. This repo consists of all of that as well as sample code to compile from nand2tetris. 
The input to this Compiler is a .jack file and the output of the CodeWriter is a .vm file

Syntax to run this compiler:

run.py <Folder_name>

Note :- The folder must contain a main function and a main file which is considered the start of execution in JACK
